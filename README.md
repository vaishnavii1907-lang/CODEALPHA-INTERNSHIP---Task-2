📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Internship Project
📌 Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset in order to:
Understand the structure and quality of the data
Identify missing values and handle them appropriately
Analyze the distribution of numerical features
Detect outliers and patterns
Study relationships between variables
Prepare clean data for further analysis or modeling
This project demonstrates data understanding, cleaning, visualization, and insight generation, which are essential skills for a Data Analyst / Data Science Intern.

📂 Project Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial first step in any data-driven project.
In this notebook, a structured and error-free EDA workflow is implemented using Python in Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda).
The analysis is carried out in a step-by-step and professional manner, ensuring reproducibility and clarity.

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas – data manipulation and analysis
NumPy – numerical computations
Matplotlib – basic data visualization
Seaborn – advanced and attractive visualizations
All libraries used are stable and commonly available in Anaconda, ensuring error-free execution.

🧩 Dataset Description
The dataset represents student academic performance, containing:
Student identifier
Marks in multiple subjects (Math, Physics, Chemistry)
Attendance percentage
The dataset includes missing values, making it suitable for demonstrating data cleaning techniques.

🔍 Steps Performed in EDA
1️⃣ Data Loading
The dataset is loaded safely into a Pandas DataFrame.
Basic validation ensures the data is available before analysis.

2️⃣ Dataset Overview
Shape of the dataset (rows and columns)
Column names and data types
Preview of the first few records
This helps in understanding the overall structure of the data.

3️⃣ Summary Statistics
Mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation are computed.
Provides a statistical overview of numerical features.

4️⃣ Missing Value Analysis
Missing values are identified for each column.
Median imputation is applied to numerical columns to maintain data integrity.

5️⃣ Data Cleaning
Duplicate records are removed.
Missing values are handled safely.
Cleaned dataset is prepared for analysis.

6️⃣ Univariate Analysis
Numerical Features
Histogram plots show data distribution.
Boxplots are used to detect outliers.
Categorical Features
Count plots display category frequencies.

7️⃣ Feature Engineerin
Total marks and average marks are calculated.
A grade column is created based on average scores.
This enhances the dataset with meaningful derived features.

8️⃣ Correlation Analysis
A correlation heatmap visualizes relationships between numerical variables.
Helps identify positively and negatively correlated features.

9️⃣ Relationship Analysis
Scatter plots analyze the relationship between attendance and performance.
Visual trends provide insights into student behavior.

🔟 Insights & Observations
Key insights are summarized at the end of the notebook, making the analysis easy to understand for non-technical stakeholders.

📊 Output & Visualizations
All charts and plots are generated clearly.
Visualizations help in understanding patterns and trends.
The cleaned dataset is saved for future use.

✅ Key Learnings
Importance of data cleaning before analysis
Handling missing values using statistical methods
Identifying outliers and distributions
Understanding feature relationships
Writing clean, readable, and professional analysis code

🎯 Conclusion
This EDA project successfully demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, from raw data to meaningful insights.
The notebook is error-free, well-structured, and suitable for internship submission, GitHub portfolio, and academic evaluation.
